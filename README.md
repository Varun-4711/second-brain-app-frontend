# Free Space : 2nd Brain App Frontend
Second Brain is a smart personal knowledge website that helps users save, organize, and semantically search diverse online content like YouTube videos, tweets, documents, and links. Built with a backend-first approach, this app leverages AI-powered embeddings and vector similarity search for context-aware discovery beyond simple keyword matches. Find the backend repo below üëáüèº.

- **Login & Authentication (JWT)**  
  Secure login and signup flow using JWT tokens.

- **Fetched Content Display**  
  Paginated, tag-filtered, and semantic search result display.\
  The title provided by the user for the added content is displayed as clickable text. This title acts as a hyperlink (anchor tag) that points to the actual YouTube video URL or content link. When users click the title, they are redirected to the original video or link in a new browser tab, allowing easy access to the source directly from the app interface.

- **Add Content Modal**  
  Modal form for adding YouTube or video links with tags.

- **Sharing Your Brain**  
  Toggle sharing on/off with a generated sharing link.

- **Semantic Search Output**  
  Query results based on vector embeddings similarity.

## Known Limitations

### Frontend Issues
- Component optimizations needed for better performance and scalability.
- UI responsiveness and accessibility can be improved.

### Backend Issues
- No rate limiting implemented; potential risk of overloading APIs.
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage, which can expose to XSS attacks; using httpOnly cookies is recommended for better security.
- Query search or filter based on tag not implemented while viewing a shareable link (brain) of other person as of now.

  
### General
- Error handling and user feedback need enhancement across features.
- The share feature is basic and could benefit from improved privacy and control.
- Used 384-dimensional embeddings for performance and efficiency, though this offers less semantic detail than higher-dimensional (e.g., 1536) vectors.
- Chose a lightweight embedding model for faster responses and lower resource use, at the cost of some accuracy for complex queries.
- Only titles (youtube + tutle given by user) are embedded - adding youtube videors descriptions and adopting more robust models could further improve search quality, but were omitted for efficiency and input size concerns.

   ```
   npm install
   ```  
   or  
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables as needed (e.g., backend API URL).

4. Start the development server:  
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```  
   or  
   ```
